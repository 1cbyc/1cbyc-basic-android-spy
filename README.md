# 1cbyc-basic-android-spy

I would work on this through the weekend and next week, making sure everything runs properly. It'll be open-source for anyone who wants help maintain afterwards.<br><br>
Going through serious stress setting the web manager for this stuff. I already plan to have my kid bro fix the css styling. I want the web manager to be visually appealing.<br><br>

For now, I'm only coding and deploying the web manager to Github. Over time, I'd upload the android app source file itself to Github.

Hopefully!
